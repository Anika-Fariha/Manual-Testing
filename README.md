## What is Manual Testing?

Manual Testing presents test cases which are the set of predefined conditions, steps, inputs, and expected outcomes used to verify a specific feature or functionality of a software application in order to allow a tester to validate whether the software behaves according to customer or stakeholder requirements.

A test case typically includes:

- Test steps
- Test data
- Preconditions
- Postconditions
- Expected vs. actual results

By executing the test case, testers can confirm that the software performs correctly or identify defects.


## How to write Test Cases?

To write effective and accurate test cases, testers typically collect and review the following documents:

1. **User Requirements Document (URD)**
   Contains business processes, user types, interaction details, functional and non-functional requirements, performance and security information.

2. **Business Use Case Document**

3. **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**

4. **Software Project Plan**

5. **QA/Test Plan**
